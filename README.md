# Music-Player

Designed and implemented a C++-based Music Player as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms, focusing on efficient data handling and user interaction. The player utilizes doubly linked lists to store songs, allowing seamless traversal and manipulation of playlists in both directions. Built a stack-based 'recently played' feature to manage playback history and support backtracking to previously played songs, while a queue structure manages upcoming songs, enabling continuous play.

File handling techniques were incorporated to save, retrieve, and update song information in an external text file, maintaining persistence across sessions. Key algorithms include optimized insertion and deletion for playlists, efficient stack and queue operations, and memory management via dynamic allocation. Additionally, error handling and input validation were implemented to enhance the robustness and usability of the application. This project demonstrates proficiency in data structure optimization, file I/O operations, and real-time application management within C++."
